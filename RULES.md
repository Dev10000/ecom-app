#### Disagreements

##### If you can't solve an argument in either 5 minutes or 10 messages, take the arguement to Perttu (together, through a daily meeting or discord call). Perttu will consult software development team, if he runs in to a problem that he can not comment on.

#### Responsibility

##### When assigning an issue, it's the assignees responsibility to finish the task the way they see fit.

##### When working on an issue, a new branch should be created to it.

##### If a team member runs in to problems with their issue, it's their responsiblity to seek help and guidance from Perttu or other team members.

##### Only the assignee can close an issue or choose to divide the issue to multiple issues.

##### You can merge branches only when the definition of done is met.

#### Respect

##### Technologies and frameworks are added and decided for the project only when the whole team is in an understanding or Perttu makes the decision.

#### DOD (Definition of Done)

1. Meets the Issue requirements and specification.
2. Passes a code review, conducted by all team members before Sprint meeting. (A team member leaves a comment on GitLab, if there's a problem. Otherwise it's expected to have passed.)
3. Passes manual testing.
